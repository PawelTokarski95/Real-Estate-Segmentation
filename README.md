# Real-Estate-Segmentation
The purpose of this project was to create a segmenation process of housing and prediction of the next segmentations. Basically, my dataset consists of a set of features for which clusters are to be assigned. The clusters determine the classification into real estate categories along with these features, making this process potentially significant for both analytical teams and developers themselves. This allows for easier segmentation of offers, such as pricing, and tailoring them to specific target groups.​​
I also created a total of three models by importing the appropriate libraries: Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest. For all these classifiers, I generated detailed classification reports, including metrics such as recall, accuracy, and precision, which are essential for evaluating model performance. Additionally, I used cross-validation to ensure the validity and reliability of the models' functioning. All models achieved very good results and are pretty reliable in terms of cross-validation score. This indicates that I would select that particular models for predictive purposes.
